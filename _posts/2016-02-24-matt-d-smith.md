The first thing that pops into my head - one of my four children, they wake up in the middle of the night, and it takes away from my sleep. That's the primary thing that legitimitely keeps me up at night.

The second answer is—thinking about business, and growing, and decisions, and ideas for projects, and a non-stop mixed bag of—not so much _"what if"_, [more] like _"ooh if I could do this"_. And then trying plan out the next days worth of work in my mind when I don't need to be thinking about that.

It's gotten less so. I feel like early on in my career it was much more so because I would be working from midnight 'til 3am to try to do more freelance work and I would still be thinking about stuff. Now I'm 10 years into my independent [freelancing] career. So now when I come home from my office I just want to relax, Netflix, and chill with my wife once the kids are in bed—you know what I mean?—Hang out with my kids, put them to bed, it takes an hour to do that because there's four of them.

Sometimes I feel, like [Meg [Robichaud]](/design/details/2016/02/22/meg-robichaud) was talking about how she has this wierd thing about Hustle. She's all about friends and fitness and family. I'll watch a _[Gary Vaynerchuk "DailyVee"](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/category/dailyvee/)_ and think _"man he's doing all kinds of stuff for 12 hours a day, I need to do more!"_. Then I think about myself and I just don't want to do that. I want to just hang out with my wife and have a good time and relax, and then I'll hit it tomorrow morning.
