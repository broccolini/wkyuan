For me it's hiring. Hiring is really hard and that's a big source of stress for me lately and is actually probably keeping me up some nights. But more than that, like big picture, I had a panic attack a while ago—not a real one, more like a mini _"holy shit what am I doing?"_—I had just finished reading _[Ready Player One](http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-Ernest-Cline/dp/030788743X)_. It's a really cool book about the future and virtual reality, and it blew my mind. I was like _"Oh yeah this is totally the next thing!"_ Facebook bought Oculus, everything's happening. Then I thought _"Oh shit! I'm a 2D designer. In 3 years I'm going to be obsolete."_ I'm like someone who doesn't do mobile or is still a Webmaster. 5 years from now I'll be like _"I don't know how to do 3D UI, I'm sorry!"_ and they'll say _"You're not hired, go away."_ I thought, holy shit I need to buy and oculus. I need to do something.

I think this ties into all this stuff there is to learn these days. Do I learn Framer, do I learn React, do I learn better illustration skills, do I get better at UX methodologies? Especially if you do a bit of everything. I call it Full Stack Anxiety, because there is just so much to learn. That definitely keeps me up at night.
