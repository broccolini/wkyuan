Two things are coming to mind. One is, can Dropbox be successful at this? It's going to be hard and there are some complex challenges. We feel very up to it, but well I've been there for 3 and a half years, I've dedicated a lot of my life to this team, and to this product, and I don't want to fail. I think Dropbox is doing incredibly, but I have really high ambitions for what I want us to accomplish, and it feels like we're just barely getting there. I really want us to win, in a way that would feel like we won to me.
2 Where are our next designers going to come from? You [Bryn and Brian] guys mentioned earlier about talking about young designers, where they are going to school, what they're learning, are they getting the tools they need to start and do great work on day one? That isn't often the case, so where's the next generation of designers going to come from because it doesn't seem like software is going anywhere, it's not going to disappear, and we need more of us.

Those types of things [keep me up at night]. Wanting to be proud of what you built, and that you spent your days work for the past 6 or 7 years (if you count all of your product design career)â€” doing stuff that mattered. That's keeps me up, in a way that drives me.
