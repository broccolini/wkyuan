What if? As far as I can remember, I very rarely sleep through the night. It's a constant question that runs through anything I've ever done. Just, what if? It's always going. That can be an identity project, that can be a snowboard trick. It's just, what if just did that? What if we did this? What if that? What if? What if? What if? It fires off all the time and it gets louder at night, that voice.

It can be very useful... I like it, I think it's good. It's a part of who I am. It's a part of what has allowed me to get to this point, and so I'll continue to take it.
