Trying to find the balance between my day job which I love—which is UX/UI and doing really awesome web work for really awesome clients—[and] doing my own personal work, which is sketching and lettering, and embroidery. Trying to figure the balance and being really stressed out about that, because if I'm choosing a more traditional side and a weird crafty thing, or something that i'm good at and makes a lot more money. Am I making the right decision of doing something that's really financially smarter or something that's a weird passion that I want to take a risk on.
