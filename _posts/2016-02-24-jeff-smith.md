It's kind of an egotistical answer, but ultimately at the end of the day I want to have a large impact on the world. I think for different people that is having kids or doing other things. For me, I want my work to be my mark, to a certain extent. The fear I have is that ultimately I would look back in 20 years from now and see a career that's—mediocre isn't the right word, actually I think mediocre is the right word, in that it's just _on par_. What scares me is that I will look back and my career and my work wasn't something that I could be really, really proud of, and feel like had an impact. What's really interesting is at [Epicurrence](https://www.epicurrence.com/) you're surrounded by people that have had that sort of impact, or at least you perceive that, and it's just interesting being within this group of people.

It can be a sort of heavy thing, for me at least. Sometimes I'll have that fear and have a hard time getting up in the morning because it's so dominating, but I think most of the time it's fairly motivating. It pushes me to do something new and progress. Over my career I've developed a lot because I'm always asking the question of _"What do I want to be doing?"_ or _"How do I have that impact?"_. I think that's a really good thing.

It's so funny. It's like [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus)—you're pushing a stone up. I'm always trying to move forward, and almost every day you're stepping back and the stone falls back.
