Hustle. I haven't quite figured out my opinion on this. It's something I want to talk about but I haven't figured out how to articulate it. I'm still only half way there, but I really hate the idea that we encourage everyone to hustle so hard.

I don't want to be a part of a community that encourages people to work instead of taking care of themselves, that instead of taking time for themselves, encourages people to burn themselves out. That doesn't teach people how to say no, and teach people how to say what a reasonable timeline is. Especially because we make up our own deadlines, and yet everyone's kind of killing themselves to get to some imaginery deadline.

I haven't quite figured out my opinion on it because I feel like my favorite thing to do, is to do something really fast. To show off that I can do it really fast. It's probably a lot of the reason that I've been successful. I feel like I'm on a high horse to say "you shouldn't hustle", "take care of yourself". I haven't figured out where I stand on that...

I feel like hustle is so glorified. People are killing themselves over it. People don't eat well and exercise, and take time with their friends, and take time with their familes. I don't want to support that and I don't want to encourage it, but it's probably how I got where I am. So I don't know where to stand on it.
