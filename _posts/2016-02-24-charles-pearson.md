There's a few things. I'm a Dad. My life is really fucking hard. My wife works. She's got a career, I've got a career. We live in The Bay Area. My kids are 8 and 10, they've got these activities, they go to school—life is just really hard and hectic. So what happens is, I fall asleep immediately at night. _Immediately_. Then two or three hours later I'm up. What happens is, I start processing everything—job, kids, career. That's just when things start to go into motion and I start thinking about things and start trying to figure them out.

There's a lot going on in my life right now. I just had this whole housing purchase re-finance thing that took forever. My parents were about to move to Atlanta but then their whole deal just fell through this afternoon, [it goes] on and on. I'm older than most of the folks here [at Epicurrence]. I'm in my mid-forties. I am ready to move to Park City and buy a Corvette and ski the rest of my life.

There's a lot of day-to-day, next steps [on my mind]. There's been a lot of talk here at Epicurrence about San Francisco and living in San Francisco. San Francisco is an _amazing_ creative epicentre. It _really_ is the core of technology and design, but it's a hard life. It's difficult in The Bay Area. I'm not going to harp on this, but as somebody who is a parent and has a career and all this, it's a difficult life. So _everything_ keeps me up at night.
