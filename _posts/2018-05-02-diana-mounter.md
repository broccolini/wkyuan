It's kind of in similar ways the same thing that was keeping me up a few years ago.

I think I'm really happy in what I'm doing right now, I get to work on design systems full time and I'm doing that at GitHub on a tool that I used before I was working there, so like a tool that I used to do my job and that I think has been a big impact on my career as a designer, like it helped me with learning to code. And so the thing that I worry about sometimes is doing a good job with design systems at GitHub with my team. Umm, and not fucking it up. And that is one of the things I think about is like sometimes I... it's really easy sometimes to sort of forget that I'm working on like an application that millions of people use because I'm deep buried in like what we call this class selector or yeah you know the _design details_.

And then I, sometimes there is a big decision to make that can have a big impact and even if it's even just css or just design systems, you know sometimes I worry about that.

And then I worry a bit more about the future now, I think as I get older, I think more about where's my career going, my spending, my being intentional about my choices and I think I've been thinking about that a lot this year because at the end of last year I was like right, okay, I took too many things on all the same time at the end of last year, I was helping write the design systems handbook (that Invision helped put together) and I was doing the clarity conference talk and there was bunch of stuff going on at work and I was doing the meetup and I was like alright, all these things landed at the same time. So I was like, 2018, do less talks, I was like I want to do more writing and focus on building up the design systems coalition and it's April and I've already done 2 or 3 talks and then I already have like another two lined up and I have multiple writing assignments because that's what it feels like, I have to write this many words and I have to put this piece together. And, running the meetup is just gotten more work and then I got more responsibilities in my day job and we just hired someone and yeah, I feel more of a responsibility to the product design team. I'm thinking more about like how to help the hiring process across the team and onboarding and things like that. So, I think being more intentional and thinking about Am i just sort of going with the flow what's flowing at me or am I making choices with thought and like spending my time on the right areas.

<deep sigh>

All of those things and Leia, our cat, he likes to come and jump on to the bed and wake me up and keep me up at night.
